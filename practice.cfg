// config file to be placed in: <CS2 DIRECTORY>/game/csgo/cfg and NOT <CS2 DIRECTORY>/csgo/cfg
// config file for me to practice nade lineups in multiplayer, as well as in singleplayer for more money and the ability to buy everywhere
// to be used on listen servers in the console of the host
// recommended: binding noclip
// also recommended: binding sv_rethrow_last_grenade and "ent_fire smokegrenade_projectile kill" to rethrow grenades and kill smokes.
// also recommended: binding "exec practice.cfg" to a key so you can run this config file without having to open the console,
// to run it manually simply input that command (exec practice.cfg) in the console
// those two commands are only usable by the host though
// i couldn't find a way to increase the max amount of grenades you can buy; it is capped to 5
// if you lose your grenades for whatever reason (i.e. dying), and can't buy any more, simply rerun this config to restart warmup, or input mp_warmup_start in the console
